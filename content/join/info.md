## Undergraduate Students
Students majoring in Computer Science and/or Computer Engineering are encouraged to apply.

* Previous research experience is not required.
* Students must be able to work an average of 10 hour per week.
* Demonstrated leadership and collaboration experience is a plus.
* Strong communication skills (written and oral) are a plus.


#### Why do research?
Through undergraduate research, you’ll: 
1) learn about the latest questions currently under scientific investigation and approaches 
being used to tackle them, 2) help solve real and important scientific problems, and 
3) gain valuable experience in critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and communication.


#### What will you do?
The SAMS Lab is focused on developing and using __________ and __________ tools for solving engineering problems. 
Undergraduate researchers will generally work on one of two tracks: 
1) simulating properties of molecules, or 2) building/using AI tools 
for discovering ___________. These may involve activities such as running 
____________ or writing/running code for AI.


#### What are the hours for the position?
Apart from attendance at weekly group meetings, students are free to work according to a 
flexible schedule. So far during COVID, all work has been remote, though we do have a lab 
office under construction for future use.


#### How do I apply?
If you’re interested in applying for a lab position or for research credit, you must 
read SAMS Lab Undergraduate Research Agreement carefully to make sure you understand 
what’s involved. Then include in a single email: (1) your resume (PDF), (2) unofficial 
copy of your transcript (PDF); freshman can send high school transcript (PDF), and (3) 
one page or less explaining why you’d like to work in our lab (PDF).
To write this well, I suggest you look at some of our papers from the last few years to 
orient yourself to our current projects. Make the subject of your [email](mailto:georgios.bouloukakis@telecom-sudparis.eu) 
“Undergrad Application” and send this to Prof. Georgios.

## Graduate Students
Students interested in pursuing a Ph.D. should apply to 
[________ doctoral programs](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/en/formation/masters-of-science/). 
Admission is determined by the department faculty committee where students are either 
admitted as direct admits or general admits.

Direct admit students have agreed to work in a particular faculty’s research lab upon 
their arrival at __________, and the faculty has agreed to serve as the student’s dissertation 
advisor and provide funding.

General admit students go through research rotations in their first year, which allows 
students to clarify student-faculty interest and develop optimal student-faculty matches. 

If you’re interested in Ph.D. with either direct or general admit, or in thesis or 
project-based masters research (majoring in ________), reach out to Prof. Georgios 
by [email](mailto:georgios.bouloukakis@telecom-sudparis.eu) with your: (1) CV, (2) a description 
of research experience and interests, and (3) 
specific information about why the SAMS Lab interests you.

<br>

## Postdoctoral Fellows
If you’re interested in a postdoc position, reach out to Prof. Georgios by [email](mailto:georgios.bouloukakis@telecom-sudparis.eu) 
with your CV and statement of research interests and background.

#### Student testimonials:
“To me, the best part of working in SAMS Lab is that I can work closely with Dr. Georgios. 
The guidance as well as insights from him keep me moving forward to the research goal. Beside 
research, we also have different activities and workshops to provide students with soft skills 
to enhance their potential. Last but not least, the lab environment is very friendly and supportive; 
lab members always offer help to others so we work as a team rather than a competition. I feel very 
happy to be a part of SAMS Lab.” – Stylianos Stamatakis, B.S. Computer Science, 2021
