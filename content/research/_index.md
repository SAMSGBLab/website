Brazil’s LGPD, and India’s PDPB) is emerging worldwide. The large amounts of highly heterogeneous data 
captured by those devices will require further processing (e.g., using machine learning algorithms) to 
become useful, but sometimes sensitive, inferences that applications and people can use. In the DAMS group 
we deal with upcoming challenges in IoT data management, especially due to the massive scale and 
heterogeneity of data and strong privacy requirements. In particular, we aim to:
