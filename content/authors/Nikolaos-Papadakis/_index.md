# Biography
I graduated from the Computer Science Department of the University of Crete in 2019 and started my masters in 2020, 
and at the time, I was interested in bioinformatics and data analysis applications. I ultimately changed course and 
I am currently absorbed in research in the field of IoT smart communities. Focused on finishing my MSc studies and 
pursuing higher education. I have basic roundabout knowledge in all areas of computer science throughout my bachelor's 
and master's degrees. Proficient in many programming languages, albeit not having used them much in real-world conditions 
outside of university assignments and research projects. Always ready to learn new things.

**BSc Thesis title**: Computational pre-processing methods for mass cytometry data.

**MSc Thesis title**: TBD (2020-2022)
