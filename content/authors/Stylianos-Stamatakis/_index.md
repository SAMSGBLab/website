# Biography

After finishing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I fell in love with the data engineering world 
and the information technology field in general. I also enjoy working with new technologies in IoT-Enabled 
Smart Buildings. In this thesis, I have successfully modeled with precision the interior of buildings using 
the FIWARE-NGSI protocol. To succeed, I extended the basic building data model provided by the FIWARE foundation 
and created data models by considering spatial properties. I demonstrate our modeling approach using the NGSI-based 
Orion context broker. In my spare time, I enjoy training, and playing Dungeon and Dragons with my friends!

**BSc Thesis title**: Prototyping smart community IoT applications via the NGSI protocol (2021-2022)
