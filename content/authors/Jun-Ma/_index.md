# Biography

I am doing research internship in Télécom SudParis/IP Paris with the topic of Balancing Energy Consumption and Comfort in Smart Spaces using the IoT. My goal is to design building domain models that relate building information to IoT devices and sensors in the space, energy consumption models, comfort concepts, and explore existing techniques, and design and implement a solution to solve the problem.

**BSc Thesis title**: Vehicle license plate recognition system on SVM and BP
